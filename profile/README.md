# Strix
**Open-source AI hackers to find and fix your app’s vulnerabilities.**

[Strix](https://strix.ai) is an open-source, agentic security platform that helps teams identify exploitable vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations across modern apps. Strix runs AI agents that **plan, investigate, and validate** issues end-to-end, producing actionable findings you can remediate quickly.

Strix is built for engineers and security teams who want:
- **Faster security feedback loops** - catch issues earlier and ship with confidence
- **High-signal findings** - less noise, more actionable remediation guidance
- **Repeatable security testing** - run continuously as your application evolves
